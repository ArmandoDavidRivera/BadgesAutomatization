# BadgesAutomatization
Code to automate the creation of stickers, badges from a csv with a list of participants

The code is based in R

Create name tags from CSV file to use in badges

It uses a predefined background image (data/background.png) and add some text from 3 different columns from a csv files (Not long text)

Add your logo to the background image and keep the dimensions of the image.
Leave an empty space in the down part for the text

Really simple and functional
